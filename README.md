# Arduino side Project I started in the summer to build a model rocket with 3d printed parts that uses a ardino flight computer with an 
# BMP280 barometric pressure sensor, MPU6050 3 Axis Gyroscope, and HC-12 for wirless comunication. Currently the project is on hold while I
# contine my education currently working on calculating acceleration for to transition to the unpowered flight state
